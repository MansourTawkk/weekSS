- I created a new Virtual Network in my resource group.
- I added a peering in order to connect both Vnets.
- I created a new Virual Machine "Elk-VM" with the specifications required.
- I assigned the public key from my ansible container from the Provisioner VM to the new elk VM.
- I allowed port 22 in elk VM, and made sure that remote access was enabled.
- I added the new VM to ansible host file.
